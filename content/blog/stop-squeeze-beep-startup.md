# How to stop the startup beep with Debian Squeeze

By googling for an answer, I found out that the most popular way was to blacklist the module pcspkr :

```
echo "blacklist pcspkr" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

Unfortunately it hasn't worked for me. In mt case I had to execute my favorite mixer (xfce-mixer) et mute PC-Beep.
