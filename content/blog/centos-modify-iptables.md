# How to modify your firewall (iptables) setting with Centos

## With GUI
Yes it's easy but you can only have very simple rules.

## File modification

You can directly modify the file generated by the GUI but beware never use the gui after or you'll loose everything. So to sum up :

*	Modify the following file : /etc/sysconfig/iptables.
*	Restart the service : /etc/init.d/iptables restart
