# How to convert a private key generated by ssh-keygen

lately I added a key to my Github account using their tutorial ([here](http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/)). So I had my private key in id_rsa. Some days ago I had to work on a github with Windows (through pageant) and I was unhappy to find that there is no real standard for the file format of private keys. Fortunately there is a solution : [Puttygen](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) (see the [faq](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#faq-ssh2-keyfmt)).

With this tool it's easy to load your id_rsa and get a .ppk file to give to pageant.
