# Some useful queries / tricks around Oracle Materialized Views

## Get all materialized views

```sql
select * from user_mviews
```

## Get latest refresh times for all materialized views

```sql
select * from user_mview_refresh_times
```

## Get information on a log

```sql
select count(*) from mlog$_MyTable;
```

## Get the list of all materialized views on a view log

```sql
SELECT master, owner, NAME, snapshot_site, 
TO_CHAR(current_snapshots,'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi') current_snapshots
FROM user_registered_snapshots, user_snapshot_logs
WHERE user_registered_snapshots.snapshot_id = user_snapshot_logs.snapshot_id (+)
```

First column is the master table and name is the materialized view name. An interesting information is the last date to check for never updated view and growing logs.

## Refresh a view

```sql
execute DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH ('MyTable', 'F');
```

You can replace the F (as Fast refresh) by a C to get a complete refresh.

## Special care on view log

You may had to add WITH SEQUENCE to your log creation to cope with certain use as stated in Oracle documentation :

Specify SEQUENCE to indicate that a sequence value providing additional ordering information should be recorded in the materialized view log. Sequence numbers are necessary to support fast refresh after some update scenarios.

## You can create a materialized view on a prebuild table

```sql
create table m (col1 number);

create materialized view log on m
with rowid (col1)
including new values;

create table
     m_mv_cstar
as
select count(*) c_star
from   m;

create materialized view m_mv_cstar
 on prebuilt table
 refresh fast
 on commit
as
select count(*) c_star
from   m;

insert into m values (1);

commit;
```

## Database link

If you need to refresh some materialized views through a db link on many schemas on the same database, be sure to give a different name to yours db links. If you don't you could have this error :

ORA-04068: existing state of packages has been discarded
ORA-04062: of has been changed
ORA-04062: timestamp of package "SYS.DBMS_SNAPSHOT_UTL" has been changed
