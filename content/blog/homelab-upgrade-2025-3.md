## Why

Backup is the main reason for using Proxmox, I was always hard to correctly backup my SBC, upgrading the OS meant installing it from scratch and restoring the backup, it was always complicated.

I hope that with Proxmox it will be easier. So far I started with one VM with all my docker stack. I'll add some LXC afterwards
