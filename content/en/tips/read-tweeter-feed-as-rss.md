# How to read a tweeter feed as RSS

I have no twitter / facebook account and I wanted to subscribe to an Twitter feed without creating an account. Here is quick howto :

*	Get the user name : http://www.twitter.com/<USER_NAME>

*	Use this website to get a user id : http://www.idfromuser.com/

*	put this url to your favorite RSS reader : http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/<USER_ID>.rss
