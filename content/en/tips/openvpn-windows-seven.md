# OpenVPN and Windows Seven

I may be unlucky but the only way to make openvpn work with Windows Seven was that way :

*	Make sure to install the last version (that is at least 2.2.1)
*	right click on your openvpn-gui-1.0.3.exe file
*	select properties
*	select tab compatibility and set it to Windows Vista Sp2
*	click the checkbox run as administrator
*	It should work
